prerequisties:
--------------------

java is required, can be installed by:

sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y

As its a third party we'l install in /opt directory.so

cd /opt

wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.7/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.7-bin.tar.gz

tar xvf apache-maven-3.8.7-bin.tar.gz

to know version installed
-------------------------

 /opt/apache-maven-3.8.7/bin/mvn --version
 
 To avoid this path we need to create enivornment variable (temporary method)
