/var- contains log files

# To be a root user
sudo -i

# To find a file/program
find / -name ssh

# To add a user
useradd <username>
passwd <passwd>

# To delete a user

userdel <username>

userdel -r <username> will delete with all directory

# To enable password authentication for Ec2
- Edit ssh config file.
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

#PermitRootLogin yes need to remove #

PasswordAuthentication no must be changed to yes

then  service sshd restart 

- To login into that user
ssh <username>@<ip address of destination>

# To see a user / details
cat /etc/passwd | grep <username>

# To see a group details
 cat /etc/group | grep <groupname>

 # To add a user to a group
 gpasswd -a <username> <groupname>

  # To remove a user to a group
 gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>

 # To see users in a group

id <groupname>

getent group <groupname>

cat /etc/group | grep <groupname>

# To delete a group

groupdel <groupname>

 # To add a user with pre-defined ID
 useradd <username> -u <ID>
 eg: useradd test -u 2255

# To add text directly to a file
echo "first test" >> test.txt

# To know info about file
getfacl <filename>

# Set file access control list help
setfacl --help

# To change ownership of a file
chown <ownername>:<groupname> file/folder

chown <ownername>:<groupname> file/folder -R (To include all subfolders)

# To move a file from one location to other

1. Symbolic approach
2. Numeric approach

Read    -r  4

Write   -w  2

Execute -X  1

Means user having full rights user:rwx =7

- For having complete privillege

chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx file/folder

- For remove other all

chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o-rwx file/folder

# To know disk usage
 df -hT

du --help

du -b /home/user

# Install nginx on aws ec2

 amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y

service nginx start

# To copy files from one machine to another

1) Generate ssh keys in source machine
ssh-keygen
once generated public key will be in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

2) copy the public key and in destination server got to

/root/.ssh

vi authorized_keys

paste

3) ssh <destination_server_username>@<destination_server_ip>

===============================================================================
second method

sudo -i

add passwd to user by passwd ubuntu

goto vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

set passwordauthentication yes

in source machine ssh-copy-id -i <location of public key> <username>@<ipaddress>


# To copy file from remote to destination

scp <filename> root@<ipaddress>:/home/

# To remote sync

rsync -avzhr sourcefolder/ root@<ipaddress>:/tmp/
